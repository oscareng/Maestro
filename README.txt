# Welcome to Maestro!

Due to restrictions on Spotify's web API please refer to the following images for the demo of this application. Alternatively, you may fork the repository and run npm start to take a look. However, you will be unable to access the main functionality of the application. Spotify's API requires whitelisting to access requests sent to their API, and I assume you would rather just take a look this way.
